I'm a web developer from Wellington, NZ. I've been working in web development since 2009 mostly in a marketing/agency environment. Most of my work has been end-to-end development of websites usually using WordPress CMS as a backend.

I recently returned home to NZ after 4.5 years living in Melbourne followed by a year of travelling. Upon arriving home I spent a few months upskilling in a self guided dev bootcamp, focusing on learning a few new technologies including Ruby/Rails and ReactJs.

Outside of work I'm usually either working on improving my dev skills & keeping up with what's new in the industry. I'm interested in business & startups, data & data visualisation, marketing, and also the environment and natural world. So spend a fair bit of time reading up on those things as well.

Occasionally I also get away from my computer, I love to get outside and explore, walking, hiking, scuba diving; or, just chilling with friends and family.
