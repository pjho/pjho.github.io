I'm a web developer from Wellington, NZ. I've been working in web development since 2009 mostly in a marketing/agency environment. Most of my work has been end-to-end development of websites usually using WordPress CMS as a backend. More recently I've been working almost exclusively with Javascript and React.js.

I recently returned home to NZ after 5 years living in Melbourne followed by a year of travelling in Australia, Thailand, NZ, the Cook Islands, Canada & the USA. 

Outside of work, if I'm not outside exploring, hiking, diving or similar, I'm most likely either working on improving my dev skills & keeping up with what's new in the industry, or chilling with friends and family.

I'm interested in business & startups, data & data visualisation, marketing, and also the environment and natural world. So spend a fair bit of time reading up on what's what in those areas as well.
