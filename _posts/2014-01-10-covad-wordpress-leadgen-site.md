####Project
The Covad Project was a Health Insurance Comparison / Application / LeadGen site. It was built on WordPress CMS and integrated to a DotNet backend via an API.

I worked with another dev on this site - my work was predominantly front-end and CMS dev, while he worked on the integations to the API.
