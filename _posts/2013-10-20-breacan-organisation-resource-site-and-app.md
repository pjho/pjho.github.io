####Project
The BreaCan project was a rebuild of an organisation/resource site for Melbourne based not-for-profit BreaCan.

The build included:
- CMS with page & blog capability
- Custom Event Management
- Library Listing & availability management
- Podcast Feed

The site was built with WordPress and contains a section which was designed to be App-like which we also had iOS & Android wrappers created to add to the experience.

This project was completed in late 2013.
