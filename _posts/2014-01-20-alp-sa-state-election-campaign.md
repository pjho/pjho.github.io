####Project
For the 2014 South Australia State Elections we were engaged in some digital campaign work for the ALP in Sout Australia. Much of this was digital advertising which we wanted to be as targeted as possible. One way we sought to achieve this was to build a network of landing pages and survey sites to be able to remarket to users who had shown interest in particular topics.

The build work in this campaign was to build a WordPress Multisite Network where small websites could be thrown up very quickly for specific MPs or topics and user interest could be ascertained from engagement with content or surveys.
