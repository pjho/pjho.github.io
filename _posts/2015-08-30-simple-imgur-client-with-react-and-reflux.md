In an effort to wrap my head around Flux architecture I've been reading many an article and followed a handfull of tutorials.

In my efforts to work out the best approach I've tried a handlful of frameworks including Reflux, Redux & Facebook's own Flux implementation.

In the process I've also picked up a bit more about React, React Router, WebPack/Browserify, Babel and ES6.
