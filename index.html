<h1>Hi there,</h1>
<p>I'm Pat, a web developer from Wellington, NZ. I've been working in web development since 2009 mostly in a marketing/agency environment. Most of my work has been end-to-end development of websites usually using WordPress CMS as a backend. More recently I've been working almost exclusively with Javascript and React.js.</p>

<p>I've been employed at Xero since mid 2015. Prior to that I spent 5 years living in Melbourne followed by a year of travelling in Australia, Thailand, NZ, the Cook Islands, Canada and the USA.</p>

<p>Outside of work, if I'm not outside exploring, hiking, diving or similar, I'm most likely either working on improving my dev skills and keeping up with what's new in the industry, or chilling with friends and family.</p>

<p>I'm interested in business and startups, data and data visualisation, marketing, and also the environment and natural world. So spend a fair bit of time reading up on what's what in those areas as well.</p>
